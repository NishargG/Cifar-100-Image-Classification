# Cifar-100-Image-Classification
Cifar-100 Image Classification (CNN,SVM)

This project focuses on implementing various classification algorithms on the
CIFAR-100 dataset. The dataset consists of 50,000 32x32 color training images and
10,000 test images distributed across 100 categories. Using Python's rich ecosystem of
machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn, We explored a
range of classification techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Through
rigorous experimentation, we evaluated the performance of these algorithms in terms of
classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability.
